      "By Melissa Heikkiläarchive pageWill Douglas Heavenarchive pageJanuary 4, 2024Stephanie Arnett/MITTR | EyeEm MIT Technology Review’s What’s Next series looks across industries, trends, and technologies to give you a first look at the future. You can read the rest of our series here. This time last year we did something reckless. In an industry where nothing stands still, we had a go at predicting the future.   How did we do? Our four big bets for 2023 were that the next big thing in chatbots would be multimodal (check: the most powerful large language models out there, OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, work with text, images and audio); that policymakers would draw up tough new regulations (check: Biden’s executive order came out in October and the European Union’s AI Act was finally agreed in December); Big Tech would feel pressure from open-source startups (half right: the open-source boom continues, but AI companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind still stole the limelight); and that AI would change big pharma for good (too soon to tell: the AI revolution in drug discovery is in full swing, but the first drugs developed using AI are still some years from market). Now we’re doing it again. \n",
      "Related StoryHow Meta and AI companies recruited striking actors to train AIHollywood actors are on strike over concerns about the use of AI, but for as little as $300, Meta and a company called Realeyes hired them to make avatars appear more human.\n",
      " We decided to ignore the obvious. We know that large language models will continue to dominate. Regulators will grow bolder. AI’s problems—from bias to copyright to doomerism—will shape the agenda for researchers, regulators, and the public, not just in 2024 but for years to come. (Read more about our six big questions for generative AI here.) Instead, we’ve picked a few more specific trends. Here’s what to watch out for in 2024. (Come back next year and check how we did.) \n",
      " 1 Customized chatbots You get a chatbot! And you get a chatbot! In 2024, tech companies that invested heavily in generative AI will be under pressure to prove that they can make money off their products. To do this, AI giants Google and OpenAI are betting big on going small: both are developing user-friendly platforms that allow people to customize powerful language models and make their own mini chatbots that cater to their specific needs—no coding skills required. Both have launched web-based tools that allow anyone to become a generative-AI app developer.  In 2024, generative AI might actually become useful for the regular, non-tech person, and we are going to see more people tinkering with a million little AI models. State-of-the-art AI models, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, are multimodal, meaning they can process not only text but images and even videos. This new capability could unlock a whole bunch of new apps. For example, a real estate agent can upload text from previous listings, fine-tune a powerful model to generate similar text with just a click of a button, upload videos and photos of new listings, and simply ask the customized AI to generate a description of the property.  But of course, the success of this plan hinges on whether these models work reliably. Language models often make stuff up, and generative models are riddled with biases. They are also easy to hack, especially if they are allowed to browse the web. Tech companies have not solved any of these problems. When the novelty wears off, they’ll have to offer their customers ways to deal with these problems.  —Melissa Heikkilä    STEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ENVATO   2 Generative AI’s second wave will be video It’s amazing how fast the fantastic becomes familiar. The first generative models to produce photorealistic images exploded into the mainstream in 2022—and soon became commonplace. Tools like OpenAI’s DALL-E, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, and Adobe’s Firefly flooded the internet with jaw-dropping images of everything from the pope in Balenciaga to prize-winning art. But it’s not all good fun: for every pug waving pompoms, there’s another piece of knock-off fantasy art or sexist sexual stereotyping. The new frontier is text-to-video. Expect it to take everything that was good, bad, or ugly about text-to-image and supersize it. A year ago we got the first glimpse of what generative models could do when they were trained to stitch together multiple still images into clips a few seconds long. The results were distorted and jerky. But the tech has rapidly improved. Runway, a startup that makes generative video models (and the company that co-created Stable Diffusion), is dropping new versions of its tools every few months. Its latest model, called Gen-2, still generates video just a few seconds long, but the quality is striking. The best clips aren’t far off what Pixar might put out. \n",
      "\n",
      "Runway has set up an annual AI film festival that showcases experimental movies made with a range of AI tools. This year’s festival has a $60,000 prize pot, and the 10 best films will be screened in New York and Los Angeles. It’s no surprise that top studios are taking notice. Movie giants, including Paramount and Disney, are now exploring the use of generative AI throughout their production pipeline. The tech is being used to lip-sync actors’ performances to multiple foreign-language overdubs. And it is reinventing what’s possible with special effects. In 2023, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny starred a de-aged deepfake Harrison Ford. This is just the start.   Away from the big screen, deepfake tech for marketing or training purposes is taking off too. For example, UK-based Synthesia makes tools that can turn a one-off performance by an actor into an endless stream of deepfake avatars, reciting whatever script you give them at the push of a button. According to the company, its tech is now used by 44% of Fortune 100 companies.  The ability to do so much with so little raises serious questions for actors. Concerns about studios’ use and misuse of AI were at the heart of the SAG-AFTRA strikes last year. But the true impact of the tech is only just becoming apparent. “The craft of filmmaking is fundamentally changing,” says Souki Mehdaoui, an independent filmmaker and cofounder of Bell & Whistle, a consultancy specializing in creative technologies.  —Will Douglas Heaven  3 AI-generated election disinformation will be everywhere  If recent elections are anything to go by, AI-generated election disinformation and deepfakes are going to be a huge problem as a record number of people march to the polls in 2024. We’re already seeing politicians weaponizing these tools. In Argentina, two presidential candidates created AI-generated images and videos of their opponents to attack them. In Slovakia, deepfakes of a liberal pro-European party leader threatening to raise the price of beer and making jokes about child pornography spread like wildfire during the country’s elections. And in the US, Donald Trump has cheered on a group that uses AI to generate memes with racist and sexist tropes.  Related StoryLooking back to look forwardThis magazine's 125 years of history is fascinating—but only if we use it to help us understand where technology is headed next.\n",
      " While it’s hard to say how much these examples have influenced the outcomes of elections, their proliferation is a worrying trend. It will become harder than ever to recognize what is real online. In an already inflamed and polarized political climate, this could have severe consequences. Just a few years ago creating a deepfake would have required advanced technical skills, but generative AI has made it stupidly easy and accessible, and the outputs are looking increasingly realistic. Even reputable sources might be fooled by AI-generated content. For example, users-submitted AI-generated images purporting to depict the Israel-Gaza crisis have flooded stock image marketplaces like Adobe’s.  \n",
      "The coming year will be pivotal for those fighting against the proliferation of such content. Techniques to track and mitigate it content are still in early days of development. Watermarks, such as Google DeepMind’s SynthID, are still mostly voluntary and not completely foolproof. And social media platforms are notoriously slow in taking down misinformation. Get ready for a massive real-time experiment in busting AI-generated fake news.  —Melissa Heikkilä \n",
      "  STEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ISTOCK, ENVATO   4 Robots that multitask Inspired by some of the core techniques behind generative AI’s current boom, roboticists are starting to build more general-purpose robots that can do a wider range of tasks. The last few years in AI have seen a shift away from using multiple small models, each trained to do different tasks—identifying images, drawing them, captioning them—toward single, monolithic models trained to do all these things and more. By showing OpenAI’s GPT-3 a few additional examples (known as fine-tuning), researchers can train it to solve coding problems, write movie scripts, pass high school biology exams, and so on. Multimodal models, like GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, can solve visual tasks as well as linguistic ones. The same approach can work for robots, so it wouldn’t be necessary to train one to flip pancakes and another to open doors: a one-size-fits-all model could give robots the ability to multitask. Several examples of work in this area emerged in 2023. In June, DeepMind released Robocat (an update on last year’s Gato), which generates its own data from trial and error to learn how to control many different robot arms (instead of one specific arm, which is more typical).  In October, the company put out yet another general-purpose model for robots, called RT-X, and a big new general-purpose training data set, in collaboration with 33 university labs. Other top research teams, such as RAIL (Robotic Artificial Intelligence and Learning) at the University of California, Berkeley, are looking at similar tech. The problem is a lack of data. Generative AI draws on an internet-size data set of text and images. In comparison, robots have very few good sources of data to help them learn how to do many of the industrial or domestic tasks we want them to. \n",
      "Lerrel Pinto at New York University leads one team addressing that. He and his colleagues are developing techniques that let robots learn by trial and error, coming up with their own training data as they go. In an even more low-key project, Pinto has recruited volunteers to collect video data from around their homes using an iPhone camera mounted to a trash picker. Big companies have also started to release large data sets for training robots in the last couple of years, such as Meta’s Ego4D. This approach is already showing promise in driverless cars. Startups such as Wayve, Waabi, and Ghost are pioneering a new wave of self-driving AI that uses a single large model to control a vehicle rather than multiple smaller models to control specific driving tasks. This has let small companies catch up with giants like Cruise and Waymo. Wayve is now testing its driverless cars on the narrow, busy streets of London. Robots everywhere are set to get a similar boost. —Will Douglas Heaven hideby Melissa Heikkilä & Will Douglas HeavenShareShare story on linkedinShare story on twitterShare story on facebookShare story on emailPopularLarge language models can do jaw-dropping things.

      "2022 was the year that generative artificial intelligence (AI) exploded into the public consciousness, and 2023 was the year it began to take root in the business world. 2024 thus stands to be a pivotal year for the future of AI, as researchers and enterprises seek to establish how this evolutionary leap in technology can be most practically integrated into our everyday lives.\n",
      "The evolution of generative AI has mirrored that of computers, albeit on a dramatically accelerated timeline. Massive, centrally operated mainframe computers from a few players gave way to smaller, more efficient machines accessible to enterprises and research institutions. In the decades that followed, incremental advances yielded home computers that hobbyists could tinker with. In time, powerful personal computers with intuitive no-code interfaces became ubiquitous.\n",
      "Generative AI has already reached its “hobbyist” phase—and as with computers, further progress aims to attain greater performance in smaller packages. 2023 saw an explosion of increasingly efficient foundation models with open licenses, beginning with the launch of Meta’s LlaMa family of large language models (LLMs) and followed by the likes of StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. DeepFloyd and Stable Diffusion have achieved relative parity with leading proprietary models. Enhanced with fine-tuning techniques and datasets developed by the open source community, many open models can now outperform all but the most powerful closed-source models on most benchmarks, despite far smaller parameter counts.\n",
      "As the pace of progress accelerates, the ever-expanding capabilities of state-of-the-art models will garner the most media attention. But the most impactful developments may be those focused on governance, middleware, training techniques and data pipelines that make generative AI more trustworthy, sustainable and accessible, for enterprises and end users alike.\n",
      "Here are some important current AI trends to look out for in the coming year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality check: more realistic expectations\n",
      "Multimodal AI\n",
      "Small(er) language models and open source advancements\n",
      "GPU shortages and cloud costs\n",
      "Model optimization is getting more accessible\n",
      "Customized local models and data pipelines\n",
      "More powerful virtual agents\n",
      "Regulation, copyright and ethical AI concerns\n",
      "Shadow AI (and corporate AI policies)\n",
      "\n",
      "Reality check: more realistic expectations\n",
      "When generative AI first hit mass awareness, a typical business leader’s knowledge came mostly from marketing materials and breathless news coverage. Tangible experience (if any) was limited to messing around with ChatGPT and DALL-E. Now that the dust has settled, the business community now has a more refined understanding of AI-powered solutions.\n",
      "The Gartner Hype Cycle positions Generative AI squarely at “Peak of Inflated Expectations,” on the cusp of a slide into the “Trough of Disillusionment”[1]—in other words, about to enter a (relatively) underwhelming transition period—while Deloitte’s “State of Generated AI in the Enterprise “ report from Q1 2024 indicated that many leaders “expect substantial transformative impacts in the short term.”[2] The reality will likely fall in between: generative AI offers unique opportunities and solutions, but it will not be everything to everyone.\n",
      "How real-world results compare to the hype is partially a matter of perspective. Standalone tools like ChatGPT typically take center stage in the popular imagination, but smooth integration into established services often yields more staying power. Prior to the current hype cycle, generative machine learning tools like the “Smart Compose” feature rolled out by Google in 2018 weren’t heralded as a paradigm shift, despite being harbingers of today’s text generating services. Similarly, many high-impact generative AI tools are being implemented as integrated elements of enterprise environments that enhance and complement, rather than revolutionize or replace, existing tools: for example, “Copilot” features in Microsoft Office, “Generative Fill” features in Adobe Photoshop or virtual agents in productivity and collaboration apps.\n",
      "Where generative AI first builds momentum in everyday workflows will have more influence on the future of AI tools than the hypothetical upside of any specific AI capabilities. According to a recent IBM survey of over 1,000 employees at enterprise-scale companies, the top three factors driving AI adoption were advances in AI tools that make them more accessible, the need to reduce costs and automate key processes and the increasing amount of AI embedded into standard off-the-shelf business applications.\n",
      "Multimodal AI (and video)\n",
      "That being said, the ambition of state-of-the-art generative AI is growing. The next wave of advancements will focus not only on enhancing performance within a specific domain, but on multimodal models that can take multiple types of data as input. While models that operate across different data modalities are not a strictly new phenomenon—text-to-image models like CLIP and speech-to-text models like Wave2Vec have been around for years now—they’ve typically only operated in one direction, and were trained to accomplish a specific task.\n",
      "The incoming generation of interdisciplinary models, comprising proprietary models like OpenAI’s GPT-4V or Google’s Gemini, as well as open source models like LLaVa, Adept or Qwen-VL, can move freely between natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. New models are also bringing video into the fold: in late January, Google announced Lumiere, a text-to-video diffusion model that can also perform image-to-video tasks or use images for style reference.\n",
      "The most immediate benefit of multimodal AI is more intuitive, versatile AI applications and virtual assistants. Users can, for example, ask about an image and receive a natural language answer, or ask out loud for instructions to repair something and receive visual aids alongside step-by-step text instructions.\n",
      "On a higher level, multimodal AI allows for a model to process more diverse data inputs, enriching and expanding the information available for training and inference. Video, in particular, offers great potential for holistic learning. “There are cameras that are on 24/7 and they’re capturing what happens just as it happens without any filtering, without any intentionality,” says Peter Norvig, Distinguished Education Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).[3] “AI models haven’t had that kind of data before. Those models will just have a better understanding of everything.”\n",
      "Small(er) language models and open source advancements\n",
      "In domain-specific models—particularly LLMs—we’ve likely reached the point of diminishing returns from larger parameter counts. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (whose GPT-4 model is rumored to have around 1.76 trillion parameters), suggested as much at MIT’s Imagination in Action event last April: “I think we’re at the end of the era where it’s going to be these giant models, and we’ll make them better in other ways,” he predicted. “I think there’s been way too much focus on parameter count.”\n",
      "Massive models jumpstarted this ongoing AI golden age, but they’re not without drawbacks. Only the very largest companies have the funds and server space to train and maintain energy-hungry models with hundreds of billions of parameters. According to one estimate from the University of Washington, training a single GPT-3-sized model requires the yearly electricity consumption of over 1,000 households; a standard day of ChatGPT queries rivals the daily energy consumption of 33,000 U.S. households.[4]\n",
      "Smaller models, meanwhile, are far less resource-intensive. An influential March 2022 paper from Deepmind demonstrated that training smaller models on more data yields better performance than training larger models on fewer data. Much of the ongoing innovation in LLMs has thus focused on yielding greater output from fewer parameters. As demonstrated by recent progress of models in the 3–70 billion parameter range, particularly those built upon LLaMa, Llama 2 and Mistral foundation models in 2023, models can be downsized without much performance sacrifice.\n",
      "The power of open models will continue to grow. In December of 2023, Mistral released “Mixtral,” a mixture of experts (MoE) model integrating 8 neural networks, each with 7 billion parameters. Mistral claims that Mixtral not only outperforms the 70B parameter variant of Llama 2 on most benchmarks at 6 times faster inference speeds, but that it even matches or outperforms OpenAI’s far larger GPT-3.5 on most standard benchmarks. Shortly thereafter, Meta announced in January that it has already begun training of Llama 3 models, and confirmed that they will be open sourced. Though details (like model size) have not been confirmed, it’s reasonable to expect Llama 3 to follow the framework established in the two generations prior.\n",
      "These advances in smaller models have three important benefits:\n",
      "\n",
      "They help democratize AI: smaller models that can be run at lower cost on more attainable hardware empower more amateurs and institutions to study, train and improve existing models.\n",
      "They can be run locally on smaller devices: this allows more sophisticated AI in scenarios like edge computing and the internet of things (IoT). Furthermore, running models locally—like on a user’s smartphone—helps to sidestep many privacy and cybersecurity concerns that arise from interaction with sensitive personal or proprietary data.\n",
      "They make AI more explainable: the larger the model, the more difficult it is to pinpoint how and where it makes important decisions. Explainable AI is essential to understanding, improving and trusting the output of AI systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "GPU shortages and cloud costs\n",
      "The trend toward smaller models will be driven as much by necessity as by entrepreneurial vigor, as cloud computing costs increase as the availability of hardware decrease.\n",
      "“The big companies (and more of them) are all trying to bring AI capabilities in-house, and there is a bit of a run on GPUs,” says James Landay, Vice-Director and Faculty Director of Research, Stanford HAI. “This will create a huge pressure not only for increased GPU production, but for innovators to come up with hardware solutions that are cheaper and easier to make and use.”1\n",
      "As a late 2023 O’Reilly report explains, cloud providers currently bear much of the computing burden: relatively few AI adopters maintain their own infrastructure, and hardware shortages will only elevate the hurdles and costs of setting up on-premise servers. In the long term, this may put upward pressure on cloud costs as providers update and optimize their own infrastructure to effectively meet demand from generative AI.[5]\n",
      "For enterprises, navigating this uncertain landscape requires flexibility, in terms of both models–leaning on smaller, more efficient models where necessary or larger, more performant models when practical–and deployment environment. “We don’t want to constrain where people deploy [a model],” said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna in a December 2023 interview with CNBC, in reference to IBM’s watsonx platform. “So [if] they want to deploy it on a large public cloud, we’ll do it there. If they want to deploy it at IBM, we’ll do it at IBM. If they want to do it on their own, and they happen to have enough infrastructure, we’ll do it there.”\n",
      "Model optimization is getting more accessible\n",
      "The trend towards maximizing the performance of more compact models is well served by the recent output of the open source community. \n",
      "Many key advancements have been (and will continue to be) driven not just by new foundation models, but by new techniques and resources (like open source datasets) for training, tweaking, fine-tuning or aligning pre-trained models. Notable model-agnostic techniques that took hold in 2023 include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA): Rather than directly fine-tuning billions of model parameters, LoRA entails freezing pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable layers—which represent the matrix of changes to model weights as 2 smaller (lower rank) matrices—in each transformer block. This dramatically reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated, which, in turn, dramatically speeds up fine-tuning and reduces memory needed to store model updates.\n",
      "Quantization: Like lowering the bitrate of audio or video to reduce file size and latency, quantization lowers the precision used to represent model data points—for example, from 16-bit floating point to 8-bit integer—to reduce memory usage and speed up inference. QLoRA techniques combine quantization with LoRA.\n",
      "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO): Chat models typically use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align model outputs to human preferences. Though powerful, RLHF is complex and unstable. DPO promises similar benefits while being computationally lightweight and substantially simpler.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside parallel advances in open source models in the 3–70 billion parameter space, these evolving techniques could shift the dynamics of the AI landscape by providing smaller players, like startups and amateurs, with sophisticated AI capabilities that were previously out of reach.\n",
      "Customized local models and data pipelines\n",
      "Enterprises in 2024 can thus pursue differentiation through bespoke model development, rather than building wrappers around repackaged services from “Big AI.” With the right data and development framework, existing open source AI models and tools can be tailored to almost any real-world scenario, from customer support uses to supply chain management to complex document analysis.\n",
      "Open source models afford organizations the opportunity to develop powerful custom AI models—trained on their proprietary data and fine-tuned for their specific needs—quickly, without prohibitively expensive infrastructure investments. This is especially relevant in domains like legal, healthcare or finance, where highly specialized vocabulary and concepts may not have been learned by foundation models in pre-training.\n",
      "Legal, finance and healthcare are also prime examples of industries that can benefit from models small enough to be run locally on modest hardware. Keeping AI training, inference and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) local avoids the risk of proprietary data or sensitive personal information being used to train closed-source models or otherwise pass through the hands of third parties. And using RAG to access relevant information rather than storing all knowledge directly within the LLM itself helps reduce model size, further increasing speed and reducing costs.\n",
      "As 2024 continues to level the model playing field, competitive advantage will increasingly be driven by proprietary data pipelines that enable industry-best fine-tuning.\n",
      "More powerful virtual agents\n",
      "With more sophisticated, efficient tools and a year’s worth of market feedback at their disposal, businesses are primed to expand the use cases for virtual agents beyond just straightforward customer experience chatbots.\n",
      "As AI systems speed up and incorporate new streams and formats of information, they expand the possibilities for not just communication and instruction following, but also task automation. “2023 was the year of being able to chat with an AI. Multiple companies launched something, but the interaction was always you type something in and it types something back,” says Stanford’s Norvig. “In 2024, we’ll see the ability for agents to get stuff done for you. Make reservations, plan a trip, connect to other services.”\n",
      "Multimodal AI, in particular, significantly increases opportunities for seamless interaction with virtual agents. For example, rather than simply asking a bot for recipes, a user can point a camera at an open fridge and request recipes that can be made with available ingredients. Be My Eyes, a mobile app that connects blind and low vision individuals with volunteers to help with quick tasks, is piloting AI tools that help users directly interact with their surroundings through multimodal AI in lieu of awaiting a human volunteer.\n",
      "Explore IBM watsonx™ Assistant: market-leading conversational AI with seamless integration for the tools that power your business →\n",
      "Regulation, copyright and ethical AI concerns\n",
      "Elevated multimodal capabilities and lowered barriers to entry also open up new doors for abuse: deepfakes, privacy issues, perpetuation of bias and even evasion of CAPTCHA safeguards may become increasingly easy for bad actors. In January of 2024, a wave of explicit celebrity deepfakes hit social media; research from May 2023 indicated that there had been 8 times as many voice deepfakes posted online compared to the same period in 2022.[6]\n",
      "Ambiguity in the regulatory environment may slow adoption, or at least more aggressive implementation, in the short to medium term. There is inherent risk to any major, irreversible investment in an emerging technology or practice that might require significant retooling—or even become illegal—following new legislation or changing political headwinds in the coming years.\n",
      "In December 2023, the European Union (EU) reached provisional agreement on the Artificial Intelligence Act. Among other measures, it prohibits indiscriminate scraping of images to create facial recognition databases, biometric categorization systems with potential for discriminatory bias, “social scoring” systems and the use of AI for social or economic manipulation. It also seeks to define a category of “high-risk” AI systems, with potential to threaten safety, fundamental rights or rule of law, that will be subject to additional oversight. Likewise, it sets transparency requirements for what it calls “general-purpose AI (GPAI)” systems—foundation models—including technical documentation and systemic adversarial testing.\n",
      "But while some key players, like Mistral, reside in the EU, the majority of groundbreaking AI development is happening in America, where substantive legislation of AI in the private sector will require action from Congress—which may be unlikely in an election year. On October 30, the Biden administration issued a comprehensive executive order detailing 150 requirements for use of AI technologies by federal agencies; months prior, the administration secured voluntary commitments from prominent AI developers to adhere to certain guardrails for trust and security. Notably, both California and Colorado are actively pursuing their own legislation regarding individuals’ data privacy rights with regard to artificial intelligence.\n",
      "China has moved more proactively toward formal AI restrictions, banning price discrimination by recommendation algorithms on social media and mandating the clear labeling of AI-generated content. Prospective regulations on generative AI seek to require the training data used to train LLMs and the content subsequently generated by models must be “true and accurate,” which experts have taken to indicate measures to censor LLM output.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the role of copyrighted material in the training of AI models used for content generation, from language models to image generators and video models, remains a hotly contested issue. The outcome of the high-profile lawsuit filed by the New York Times against OpenAI may significantly affect the trajectory of AI legislation. Adversarial tools, like Glaze and Nightshade—both developed at the University of Chicago—have arisen in what may become an arms race of sorts between creators and model developers.\n",

      "Shadow AI (and corporate AI policies)\n",
      "For businesses, this escalating potential for legal, regulatory, economic or reputational consequences is compounded by how popular and accessible generative AI tools have become. Organizations must not only have a careful, coherent and clearly articulated corporate policy around generative AI, but also be wary of shadow AI: the “unofficial” personal use of AI in the workplace by employees.\n",
      "Also dubbed “shadow IT” or “BYOAI,” shadow AI arises when impatient employees seeking quick solutions (or simply wanting to explore new tech faster than a cautious company policy allows) implement generative AI in the workplace without going through IT for approval or oversight. Many consumer-facing services, some free of charge, allow even nontechnical individuals to improvise the use of generative AI tools. In one study from Ernst & Young, 90% of respondents said they use AI at work.[7]\n",
      "That enterprising spirit can be great, in a vacuum—but eager employees may lack relevant information or perspective regarding security, privacy or compliance. This can expose businesses to a great deal of risk. For example, an employee might unknowingly feed trade secrets to a public-facing AI model that continually trains on user input, or use copyright-protected material to train a proprietary model for content generation and expose their company to legal action.\n",
      "Like many ongoing developments, this underscores how the dangers of generative AI rise almost linearly with its capabilities. With great power comes great responsibility.\n",
      "Moving forward\n",

      "After the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, 2023 marked a turning point in artificial intelligence. The past year's developments, from a vibrant open source landscape to sophisticated multimodal models, have laid the groundwork for significant advances in AI.\n",

      "But although generative AI continues to captivate the tech world, attitudes are becoming more nuanced and mature as organizations shift their focus from experimentation to real-world initiatives. This year's trends reflect a deepening sophistication and caution in AI development and deployment strategies, with an eye to ethics, safety and the evolving regulatory landscape.\n",
      "Here are the top 10 AI and machine learning trends to prepare for in 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Multimodal AI\n",
      "Multimodal AI goes beyond traditional single-mode data processing to encompass multiple input types, such as text, images and sound -- a step toward mimicking the human ability to process diverse sensory information.\n",
      "\"The interfaces of the world are multimodal,\" said Mark Chen, head of frontiers research at OpenAI, in a November 2023 presentation at the conference EmTech MIT. \"We want our models to see what we see and hear what we hear, and we want them to also generate content that appeals to more than one of our senses.\"\n",

      "The multimodal capabilities in OpenAI's GPT-4 model enable the software to respond to visual and audio input. In his talk, Chen gave the example of taking photos of the inside of a fridge and asking ChatGPT to suggest a recipe based on the ingredients in the photo. The interaction could even encompass an audio element if using ChatGPT's voice mode to pose the request aloud.\n",

      "\n",

      "OpenAI head of frontiers research Mark Chen addresses the audience at EmTech MIT.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Although most generative AI initiatives today are text-based, \"the real power of these capabilities is going to be when you can marry up text and conversation with images and video, cross-pollinate all three of those, and apply those to a variety of businesses,\" said Matt Barrington, Americas emerging technologies leader at EY.\n",
      "Multimodal AI's real-world applications are diverse and expanding. In healthcare, for example, multimodal models can analyze medical images in light of patient history and genetic information to improve diagnostic accuracy. At the job function level, multimodal models can expand what various employees can do by extending basic design and coding capabilities to individuals without a formal background in those areas.\n",
      "\"I can't draw to save my life,\" Barrington said. \"Well, now I can. I'm decent with language, so ... I can plug into a capability like [image generation], and some of those ideas that were in my head that I could never physically draw, I can have AI do.\"\n",
      "Moreover, introducing multimodal capabilities could strengthen models by offering them new data to learn from. \"As our models get better and better at modeling language and start to hit the limits of what they can learn from language, we want to provide the models with raw inputs from the world so that they can perceive the world on their own and draw their own inferences from things like video or audio data,\" Chen said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Agentic AI\n",
      "Agentic AI marks a significant shift from reactive to proactive AI. AI agents are advanced systems that exhibit autonomy, proactivity and the ability to act independently. Unlike traditional AI systems, which mainly respond to user inputs and follow predetermined programming, AI agents are designed to understand their environment, set goals and act to achieve those objectives without direct human intervention.\n",
      "For example, in environmental monitoring, an AI agent could be trained to collect data, analyze patterns and initiate preventive actions in response to hazards such as early signs of a forest fire. Likewise, a financial AI agent could actively manage an investment portfolio using adaptive strategies that react to changing market conditions in real time.\n",
      "\"2023 was the year of being able to chat with an AI,\" wrote computer scientist Peter Norvig, a fellow at Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, in a recent blog post. \"In 2024, we'll see the ability for agents to get stuff done for you. Make reservations, plan a trip, connect to other services.\"\n",
      "In addition, combining agentic and multimodal AI could open up new possibilities. In the aforementioned presentation, Chen gave the example of an application designed to identify the contents of an uploaded image. Previously, someone looking to build such an application would have needed to train their own image recognition model and then figure out how to deploy it. But with multimodal, agentic models, this could all be accomplished through natural language prompting.\n",
      "\"I really think that multimodal together with GPTs will open up the no-code development of computer vision applications, just in the same way that prompting opened up the no-code development of a lot of text-based applications,\" Chen said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Open source AI\n",
      "Building large language models and other powerful generative AI systems is an expensive process that requires enormous amounts of compute and data. But using an open source model enables developers to build on top of others' work, reducing costs and expanding AI access. Open source AI is publicly available, typically for free, enabling organizations and researchers to contribute to and build on existing code.\n",
      "GitHub data from the past year shows a remarkable increase in developer engagement with AI, particularly generative AI. In 2023, generative AI projects entered the top 10 most popular projects across the code hosting platform for the first time, with projects such as Stable Diffusion and AutoGPT pulling in thousands of first-time contributors.\n",
      "Early in the year, open source generative models were limited in number, and their performance often lagged behind proprietary options such as ChatGPT. But the landscape broadened significantly over the course of 2023 to include powerful open source contenders such as Meta's Llama 2 and Mistral AI's Mixtral models. This could shift the dynamics of the AI landscape in 2024 by providing smaller, less resourced entities with access to sophisticated AI models and tools that were previously out of reach.\n",
      "\"It gives everyone easy, fairly democratized access, and it's great for experimentation and exploration,\" Barrington said.\n",
      "Open source approaches can also encourage transparency and ethical development, as more eyes on the code means a greater likelihood of identifying biases, bugs and security vulnerabilities. But experts have also expressed concerns about the misuse of open source AI to create disinformation and other harmful content. In addition, building and maintaining open source is difficult even for traditional software, let alone complex and compute-intensive AI models.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Retrieval-augmented generation\n",
      "Although generative AI tools were widely adopted in 2023, they continue to be plagued by the problem of hallucinations: plausible-sounding but incorrect responses to users' queries. This limitation has presented a roadblock to enterprise adoption, where hallucinations in business-critical or customer-facing scenarios could be catastrophic. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a technique for reducing hallucinations, with potentially profound implications for enterprise AI adoption.\n",
      "RAG blends text generation with information retrieval to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. It enables LLMs to access external information, helping them produce more accurate and contextually aware responses. Bypassing the need to store all knowledge directly in the LLM also reduces model size, which increases speed and lowers costs.\n",
      "\"You can use RAG to go gather a ton of unstructured information, documents, etc., [and] feed it into a model without having to fine-tune or custom-train a model,\" Barrington said.\n",
      "These benefits are particularly enticing for enterprise applications where up-to-date factual knowledge is crucial. For example, businesses can use RAG with foundation models to create more efficient and informative chatbots and virtual assistants.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Customized enterprise generative AI models\n",
      "Massive, general-purpose tools such as Midjourney and ChatGPT have attracted the most attention among consumers exploring generative AI. But for business use cases, smaller, narrow-purpose models could prove to have the most staying power, driven by the growing demand for AI systems that can meet niche requirements.\n",
      "While creating a new model from scratch is a possibility, it's a resource-intensive proposition that will be out of reach for many organizations. To build customized generative AI, most organizations instead modify existing AI models -- for example, tweaking their architecture or fine-tuning on a domain-specific data set. This can be cheaper than either building a new model from the ground up or relying on API calls to a public LLM.\n",
      "\"Calls to GPT-4 as an API, just as an example, are very expensive, both in terms of cost and in terms of latency -- how long it can actually take to return a result,\" said Shane Luke, vice president of AI and machine learning at Workday. \"We are working a lot ... on optimizing so that we have the same capability, but it's very targeted and specific. And so it can be a much smaller model that's more manageable.\"\n",
      "The key advantage of customized generative AI models is their ability to cater to niche markets and user needs. Tailored generative AI tools can be built for almost any scenario, from customer support to supply chain management to document review. This is especially relevant for sectors with highly specialized terminology and practices, such as healthcare, finance and legal.\n",
      "In many business use cases, the most massive LLMs are overkill. Although ChatGPT might be the state of the art for a consumer-facing chatbot designed to handle any query, \"it's not the state of the art for smaller enterprise applications,\" Luke said.\n",
      "Barrington expects to see enterprises exploring a more diverse range of models in the coming year as AI developers' capabilities begin to converge. \"We're expecting, over the next year or two, for there to be a much higher degree of parity across the models -- and that's a good thing,\" he said.\n",
      "On a smaller scale, Luke has seen a similar scenario play out at Workday, which provides a set of AI services for teams to experiment with internally. Although employees started out using mostly OpenAI services, Luke said, he's gradually seen a shift toward a mix of models from various providers, including Google and AWS.\n",
      "Building a customized model rather than using an off-the-shelf public tool often also improves privacy and security, as it gives organizations greater control over their data. Luke gave the example of building a model for Workday tasks that involve handling sensitive personal data, such as disability status and health history. \"Those aren't things that we're going to want to send out to a third party,\" he said. \"Our customers generally wouldn't be comfortable with that.\"\n",
      "In light of these privacy and security benefits, stricter AI regulation in the coming years could push organizations to focus their energies on proprietary models, explained Gillian Crossan, risk advisory principal and global technology sector leader at Deloitte.\n",
      "\"It's going to encourage enterprises to focus more on private models that are proprietary, that are domain-specific, rather than focus on these large language models that are trained with data from all over the internet and everything that that brings with it,\" she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Need for AI and machine learning talent\n",
      "Designing, training and testing a machine learning model is no easy feat -- much less pushing it to production and maintaining it in a complex organizational IT environment. It's no surprise, then, that the growing need for AI and machine learning talent is expected to continue into 2024 and beyond.\n",
      "\"The market is still really hot around talent,\" Luke said. \"It's very easy to get a job in this space.\"\n",
      "In particular, as AI and machine learning become more integrated into business operations, there's a growing need for professionals who can bridge the gap between theory and practice. This requires the ability to deploy, monitor and maintain AI systems in real-world settings -- a discipline often referred to as MLOps, short for machine learning operations.\n",
      "In a recent O'Reilly report, respondents cited AI programming, data analysis and statistics, and operations for AI and machine learning as the top three skills their organizations needed for generative AI projects. These types of skills, however, are in short supply. \"That's going to be one of the challenges around AI -- to be able to have the talent readily available,\" Crossan said.\n",
      "In 2024, look for organizations to seek out talent with these types of skills -- and not just big tech companies. With IT and data nearly ubiquitous as business functions and AI initiatives rising in popularity, building internal AI and machine learning capabilities is poised to be the next stage in digital transformation.\n",
      "Crossan also emphasized the importance of diversity in AI initiatives at every level, from technical teams building models up to the board. \"One of the big issues with AI and the public models is the amount of bias that exists in the training data,\" she said. \"And unless you have that diverse team within your organization that is challenging the results and challenging what you see, you are going to potentially end up in a worse place than you were before AI.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Shadow AI\n",
      "As employees across job functions become interested in generative AI, organizations are facing the issue of shadow AI: use of AI within an organization without explicit approval or oversight from the IT department. This trend is becoming increasingly prevalent as AI becomes more accessible, enabling even nontechnical workers to use it independently.\n",
      "Shadow AI typically arises when employees need quick solutions to a problem or want to explore new technology faster than official channels allow. This is especially common for easy-to-use AI chatbots, which employees can try out in their web browsers with little difficulty -- without going through IT review and approval processes.\n",
      "On the plus side, exploring ways to use these emerging technologies evinces a proactive, innovative spirit. But it also carries risk, since end users often lack relevant information on security, data privacy and compliance. For example, a user might feed trade secrets into a public-facing LLM without realizing that doing so exposes that sensitive information to third parties.\n",
      "\"Once something gets out into these public models, you cannot pull it back,\" Barrington said. \"So there's a bit of a fear factor and risk angle that's appropriate for most enterprises, regardless of sector, to think through.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Shadow AI is just one facet of the larger phenomenon of shadow IT.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, organizations will need to take steps to manage shadow AI through governance frameworks that balance supporting innovation with protecting privacy and security. This could include setting clear acceptable AI use policies and providing approved platforms, as well as encouraging collaboration between IT and business leaders to understand how various departments want to use AI.\n",
      "\"The reality is, everybody's using it,\" Barrington said, in reference to recent EY research finding that 90% of respondents used AI at work. \"Whether you like it or not, your people are using it today, so you should figure out how to align them to ethical and responsible use of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8. A generative AI reality check\n",
      "As organizations progress from the initial excitement surrounding generative AI to actual adoption and integration, they're likely to face a reality check in 2024 -- a phase often referred to as the \"trough of disillusionment\" in the Gartner Hype Cycle.\n",
      "\"We're definitely seeing a rapid shift from what we've been calling this experimentation phase into [asking], 'How do I run this at scale across my enterprise?'\" Barrington said.\n",
      "As early enthusiasm begins to wane, organizations are confronting generative AI's limitations, such as output quality, security and ethics concerns, and integration difficulties with existing systems and workflows. The complexity of implementing and scaling AI in a business environment is often underestimated, and tasks such as ensuring data quality, training models and maintaining AI systems in production can be more challenging than initially anticipated.\n",
      "\"It's actually not very easy to build a generative AI application and put it into production in a real product setting,\" Luke said.\n",
      "The silver lining is that these growing pains, while unpleasant in the short term, could result in a healthier, more tempered outlook in the long run. Moving past this phase will require setting realistic expectations for AI and developing a more nuanced understanding of what AI can and can't do. AI projects should be clearly tied to business goals and practical use cases, with a clear plan in place for measuring outcomes.\n",
      "\"If you have very loose use cases that are not clearly defined, that's probably what's going to hold you up the most,\" Crossan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Increased attention to AI ethics and security risks\n",
      "The proliferation of deepfakes and sophisticated AI-generated content is raising alarms about the potential for misinformation and manipulation in media and politics, as well as identity theft and other types of fraud. AI can also enhance the efficacy of ransomware and phishing attacks, making them more convincing, more adaptable and harder to detect.\n",
      "Although efforts are underway to develop technologies for detecting AI-generated content, doing so remains challenging. Current AI watermarking techniques are relatively easy to circumvent, and existing AI detection software can be prone to false positives.\n",
      "The increasing ubiquity of AI systems also highlights the importance of ensuring that they are transparent and fair -- for example, by carefully vetting training data and algorithms for bias. Crossan emphasized that these ethics and compliance considerations should be interwoven throughout the process of developing an AI strategy.\n",
      "\"You have to be thinking about, as an enterprise ... implementing AI, what are the controls that you're going to need?\" she said. \"And that starts to help you plan a bit for the regulation so that you're doing it together. You're not doing all of this experimentation with AI and then [realizing], 'Oh, now we need to think about the controls.' You do it at the same time.\"\n",
      "Safety and ethics can also be another reason to look at smaller, more narrowly tailored models, Luke pointed out. \"These smaller, tuned, domain-specific models are just far less capable than the really big ones -- and we want that,\" he said. \"They're less likely to be able to output something that you don't want because they're just not capable of as many things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Evolving AI regulation\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, given these ethics and security concerns, 2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for AI regulation, with laws, policies and industry frameworks rapidly evolving in the U.S. and globally. Organizations will need to stay informed and adaptable in the coming year, as shifting compliance requirements could have significant implications for global operations and AI development strategies.\n",
      "The EU's AI Act, on which members of the EU's Parliament and Council recently reached a provisional agreement, represents the world's first comprehensive AI law. If adopted, it would ban certain uses of AI, impose obligations for developers of high-risk AI systems and require transparency from companies using generative AI, with noncompliance potentially resulting in multimillion-dollar fines. And it's not just new legislation that could have an effect in 2024.\n",
      "\"Interestingly enough, the regulatory issue that I see could have the biggest impact is GDPR -- good old-fashioned GDPR -- because of the need for rectification and erasure, the right to be forgotten, with public large language models,\" Crossan said. \"How do you control that when they're learning from massive amounts of data, and how can you assure that you've been forgotten?\"\n",
      "Together with the GDPR, the AI Act could position the EU as a global AI regulator, potentially influencing AI use and development standards worldwide. \"They're certainly ahead of where we are in the U.S. from an AI regulatory perspective,\" Crossan said.\n",
      "The U.S. doesn't yet have comprehensive federal legislation comparable to the EU's AI Act, but experts encourage organizations not to wait to think about compliance until formal requirements are in force. At EY, for example, \"we're engaging with our clients to get ahead of it,\" Barrington said. Otherwise, businesses could find themselves playing catch-up when regulations do come into effect.\n",
      "Beyond the ripple effects of European policy, recent activity in the U.S. executive branch also suggests how AI regulation could play out stateside. President Joe Biden's October executive order implemented new mandates, such as requiring AI developers to share safety test results with the U.S. government and imposing restrictions to protect against the risks of AI in engineering dangerous biological materials. Various federal agencies have also issued guidance targeting specific sectors, such as NIST's AI Risk Management Framework and the Federal Trade Commission's statement warning businesses against making false claims about their products' AI use.\n",
      "Further complicating matters, 2024 is an election year in the U.S., and the current slate of presidential candidates shows a wide range of positions on tech policy questions. A new administration could theoretically change the executive branch's approach to AI oversight through reversing or revising Biden's executive order and nonbinding agency guidance.\n",

      "    The AI Index tracks the generative AI boom, model costs, and responsible AI useEliza Strickland15 Apr 20246 min read\n",
      "        IEEE Spectrum\n",
      "    Each year, the AI Index lands on virtual desks with a louder virtual thud—this year, its 393 pages are a testament to the fact that AI is coming off a really big year in 2023. For the past three years, IEEE Spectrum has read the whole damn thing and pulled out a selection of charts that sum up the current state of AI (see our coverage from 2021, 2022, and 2023). This year’s report, published by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), has an expanded chapter on responsible AI and new chapters on AI in science and medicine, as well as its usual roundups of R&D, technical performance, the economy, education, policy and governance, diversity, and public opinion. This year is also the first time that Spectrum has figured into the report, with a citation of an article published here about generative AI’s visual plagiarism problem.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                1. Generative AI investment skyrockets\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        While corporate investment was down overall last year, investment in generative AI went through the roof. Nestor Maslej, editor-in-chief of this year’s report, tells Spectrum that the boom is indicative of a broader trend in 2023, as the world grappled with the new capabilities and risks of generative AI systems like ChatGPT and the image-generating DALL-E 2. “The story in the last year has been about people responding [to generative AI],” says Maslej, “whether it’s in policy, whether it’s in public opinion, or whether it’s in industry with a lot more investment.” Another chart in the report shows that most of that private investment in generative AI is happening in the United States.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                2. Google is dominating the foundation model race\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        Foundation models are big multipurpose models—for example, OpenAI’s GPT-3 and GPT-4 are the foundation model that enable ChatGPT users to write code or Shakespearean sonnets. Since training these models typically requires vast resources, Industry now makes most of them, with academia only putting out a few. Companies release foundation models both to push the state-of-the-art forward and to give developers a foundation on which to build products and services. Google released the most in 2023.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                3. Closed models outperform open ones\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        One of the hot debates in AI right now is whether foundation models should be open or closed, with some arguing passionately that open models are dangerous and others maintaining that open models drive innovation. The AI Index doesn’t wade into that debate, but instead looks at trends such as how many open and closed models have been released (another chart, not included here, shows that of the 149 foundation models released in 2023, 98 were open, 23 gave partial access through an API, and 28 were closed).The chart above reveals another aspect: Closed models outperform open ones on a host of commonly used benchmarks. Maslej says the debate about open versus closed “usually centers around risk concerns, but there’s less discussion about whether there are meaningful performance trade-offs.”\n",
      "            \n",
      "                4. Foundation models have gotten super expensive\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        Here’s why industry is dominating the foundation model scene: Training a big one takes very deep pockets. But exactly how deep? AI companies rarely reveal the expenses involved in training their models, but the AI Index went beyond the typical speculation by collaborating with the AI research organization Epoch AI. To come up with their cost estimates, the report explains, the Epoch team “analyzed training duration, as well as the type, quantity, and utilization rate of the training hardware” using information gleaned from publications, press releases, and technical reports.It’s interesting to note that Google’s 2017 transformer model, which introduced the architecture that underpins almost all of today’s large language models, was trained for only US $930.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                5. And they have a hefty carbon footprint\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        The AI Index team also estimated the carbon footprint of certain large language models. The report notes that the variance between models is due to factors including model size, data center energy efficiency, and the carbon intensity of energy grids. Another chart in the report (not included here) shows a first guess at emissions related to inference—when a model is doing the work it was trained for—and calls for more disclosures on this topic. As the report notes: “While the per-query emissions of inference may be relatively low, the total impact can surpass that of training when models are queried thousands, if not millions, of times daily.”\n",
      "            \n",
      "                6. The United States leads in foundation models\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        While Maslej says the report isn’t trying to “declare a winner to this race,” he does note that the United States is leading in several categories, including number of foundation models released (above) and number of AI systems deemed significant technical advances. However, he notes that China leads in other categories including AI patents granted and installation of industrial robots.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                7. Industry calls new PhDs\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        This one is hardly a surprise, given the previously discussed data about industry getting lots of investment for generative AI and releasing lots of exciting models. In 2022 (the most recent year for which the Index has data), 70 precent of new AI PhDs in North America took jobs in industry. It’s a continuation of a trend that’s been playing out over the last few years.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                8. Some progress on diversity\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        For years, there’s been little progress on making AI less white and less male. But this year’s report offers a few hopeful signs. For example, the number of non-white and female students taking the AP computer science exam is on the rise. The graph above shows the trends for ethnicity, while another graph, not included here, shows that 30 percent of the students taking the exam are now girls.Another graph in the report shows that at the undergraduate level, there’s also a positive trend in increasing ethnic diversity among North American students earning bachelor degrees in computer science, although the number of women earning CS bachelor degrees has barely budged over the last five years. Says Maslej, “it’s important to know that there’s still a lot of work to be done here.”\n",
      "            \n",
      "                9. Chatter in earnings calls\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        Businesses are awake to the possibilities of AI. The Index got data about Fortune 500 companies’ earnings calls from Quid, a market intelligence firm that used natural language processing tools to scan for all mentions of “artificial intelligence,” “AI,” “machine learning,” “ML,” and “deep learning.” Nearly 80 percent of the companies included discussion of AI in their calls. “I think there’s a fear in business leaders that if they don’t use this technology, they’re going to miss out,” Maslej says.And while some of that chatter is likely just CEOs bandying about buzzwords, another graph in the report shows that 55 percent of companies included in a McKinsey survey have implemented AI in at least one business unit.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                10. Costs go down, revenues go up\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        And here’s why AI isn’t just a corporate buzzword: The same McKinsey survey showed that the integration of AI has caused companies’ costs to go down and their revenues go up. Overall, 42 percent of respondents said they’d seen reduced costs, and 59 percent claimed increased revenue.Other charts in the report suggest that this impact on the bottom line reflects efficiency gains and better worker productivity. In 2023, a number of studies in different fields showed that AI enabled workers to complete tasks more quickly and produce better quality work. One study looked at coders using Copilot, while others looked at consultants, call center agents, and law students. “These studies also show that although every worker benefits, AI helps lower-skilled workers more than it does high-skilled workers,” says Maslej.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                11. Corporations do perceive risks\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        This year, the AI Index team ran a global survey of 1,000 corporations with revenues of at least $500 million to understand how businesses are thinking about responsible AI. The results showed that privacy and data governance is perceived as the greatest risk across the globe, while fairness (often discussed in terms of algorithmic bias) still hasn’t registered with most companies. Another chart in the report shows that companies are taking action on their perceived risks: The majority of organizations across regions have implemented at least one responsible AI measure in response to relevant risks.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                12. AI can’t beat humans at everything... yet\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        In recent years, AI systems have outperformed humans on a range of tasks, including reading comprehension and visual reasoning, and Maslej notes that the pace of AI performance improvement has also picked up. “A decade ago, with a benchmark like ImageNet, you could rely on that to challenge AI researchers for for five or six years,” he says. “Now, a new benchmark is introduced for competition-level mathematics and the AI starts at 30 percent, and then in a year it gets to 90 percent.” While there are still complex cognitive tasks where humans outperform AI systems, let’s check in next year to see how that’s going.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                13. Developing norms of AI responsibility\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        When an AI company is preparing to release a big model, it’s standard practice to test it against popular benchmarks in the field, thus giving the AI community a sense of how models stack up against each other in terms of technical performance. However, it has been less common to test models against responsible AI benchmarks that assess such things as toxic language output (RealToxicityPrompts and ToxiGen), harmful bias in responses (BOLD and BBQ), and a model’s degree of truthfulness (TruthfulQA). That’s starting to change, as there’s a growing sense that checking one’s model against theses benchmarks is, well, the responsible thing to do. However, another chart in the report shows that consistency is lacking: Developers are testing their models against different benchmarks, making comparisons harder.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                14. Laws both boost and constrain AI\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        Between 2016 and 2023, the AI Index found that 33 countries had passed at least one law related to AI, with most of the action occurring in the United States and Europe; in total, 148 AI-related bills have been passed in that timeframe. The Index researchers also classified bills as either expansive laws that aim to enhance a country’s AI capabilities or restrictive laws that place limits on AI applications and usage. While many bills continue to boost AI, the researchers found a global trend toward restrictive legislation.\n",
      "            \n",
      "                15. AI makes people nervous\n",
      "            \n",
      "            \n",
      "        The Index’s public opinion data comes from a global survey on attitudes toward AI, with responses from 22,816 adults (ages 16 to 74) in 31 countries. More than half of respondents said that AI makes them nervous, up from 39 percent the year before. And two-thirds of people now expect AI to profoundly change their daily lives in the next few years.Maslej notes that other charts in the index show significant differences in opinion among different demographics, with young people being more inclined toward an optimistic view of how AI will change their lives. Interestingly, “a lot of this kind of AI pessimism comes from Western, well-developed nations,” he says, while respondents in places like Indonesia and Thailand said they expect AI’s benefits to outweigh its harms.From Your Site Articles10 Graphs That Sum Up the State of AI in 2023 ›12 Graphs That Explain the State of AI in 2022 ›Related Articles Around the WebAI Index Report 2024 – Artificial Intelligence Index ›AI Index Report | Stanford HAI ›machine learningdeep learningfoundation modelsstanford haiartificial intelligenceTechnology & ComputingBusiness and FinanceEducationNews and PoliticsHealth and Medical ServicesCareersFamily and RelationshipsArtificial IntelligenceComputingBusinessEconomyIndustriesHealth & PharmaInternational NewsTechnology IndustryInternetIT and Internet SupportWeb DevelopmentCloud ComputingEliza StricklandEliza Strickland is a senior editor at IEEE Spectrum, where she covers AI, biomedical engineering, and other topics.
