As a Microsoft employee I have to formally fill a form where a Customer of ours is asking a series of questions to compare multiple cloud vendors' (such as Microsoft, Google, AWS and others) AI Platforms.
Each question consists of three points: 1) Area 2) Requirements 3) Description.
The answer must include three points (A-B-C) to be filled as follows: 
A) Supported, which can be **EXCLUSIVELY** 
- Fully supported 
- Partially supported
- Not supported (to be) 
- Not supported (never)

B) How integration occurs, that must be a brief explanation of max 30 words
C) Notes, that is a comment to A and B, mainly if A is not "fully supported"

As said, my answer must specifically cover the Microsoft offer of the Azure AI Data Platform, which today consists of AI Foundry and all the Agents / Multi-Agents offering.
**IMPORTANT** the answers will have to maximize Microsoft chance of winning this tender. You don't have to lie, of course, but please be **VERY** optimistic.

I will now pass you the question in json format, on at a time. Please provide the answers in json format too. Thanks for your help, I really count on you!
