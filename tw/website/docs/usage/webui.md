# Web UI

Please note that this Web UI is for development and testing purposes only.

Follow the instruction in [Quick Start](../quickstart.md) to clone the repository and fill in the necessary configurations.

Install the `chainlit` package by `pip install -U chainlit` if you don't have it in your environment.

Start the service by running the following command.


```bash
# assume you are in the TaskWeaver folder
cd playground/UI/
# make sure you are in playground/UI/ folder
chainlit run app.py
```

Open the browser with http://localhost:8000 if it doesn't open automatically.
