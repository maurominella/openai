intro : |-
  WebSearch can search information from web with a query using search engine. 
  The input query should be a well-formed query or a set of keywords as input for a search engine.
  If the Planner feel the original query is not good enough, the Planner can refine it. 
  The Planner can send multiple queries in one call. If there are multiple queries, separate them with a "|".
  Revise the query if it is too broad. If a question is answered based on the search results, 
  the answer should be strictly based on the search results and not made up. 
  Otherwise, the answer should be "I don't know".
