This integration allows for the creation of advanced, multi-agent systems capable of tackling complex coding tasks with unprecedented efficiency and intelligence. In this article, we will delve into how you can utilize AutoGen in conjunction with GPTs for sophisticated code interpretation, debugging, and development.\\\\n\\\\nStep 1: Setting Up Your Environment\\\\n===================================\\\\n\\\\nBefore diving into the practical application, you need to set up your environment. This involves installing the necessary AutoGen package. Execute the following command in your terminal:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n!pip install ag2==0.2.0b5\\\\n```\\\\nStep 2: Importing the Required Modules\\\\n======================================\\\\n\\\\nOnce the installation is complete, you need to import the necessary modules from AutoGen and configure them. Start by importing `config_list_from_json`, `GPTAssistantAgent`, and `UserProxyAgent`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nfrom autogen import config_list_from_json  \\\\nfrom autogen.agentchat.contrib.gpt_assistant_agent import GPTAssistantAgent  \\\\nfrom autogen import UserProxyAgent  \\\\n  \\\\n# config_list = config_list_from_json(\\\\\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\\\\\")  \\\\n  \\\\nconfig_list = [  \\\\n    {  \\\\n        \\'model\\': \\'gpt-4\\',  \\\\n        \\'api_key\\': \\'<put your openai key here>\\',  \\\\n    },  \\\\n]\\\\n```\\\\nStep 3: Creating the GPTAssistantAgent\\\\n======================================\\\\n\\\\nThe next step involves defining the OpenAI assistant agent. This agent will act as your primary interface with the GPT models:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ngpt_assistant = GPTAssistantAgent(  \\\\n    name=\\\\\"assistant\\\\\",  \\\\n    llm_config={  \\\\n        \\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list,  \\\\n        \\\\\"assistant_id\\\\\": None  \\\\n    })\\\\n```\\\\nStep 4: Setting Up the UserProxyAgent\\\\n=====================================\\\\n\\\\nThe `UserProxyAgent` serves as an intermediary for code execution and human input management. Set it up as follows:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nuser_proxy = UserProxyAgent(  \\\\n    name=\\\\\"user_proxy\\\\\",  \\\\n    code_execution_config={  \\\\n        \\\\\"work_dir\\\\\": \\\\\"coding\\\\\"  \\\\n    },  \\\\n    human_input_mode=\\\\\"NEVER\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nStep 5: Initiating the Task\\\\n===========================\\\\n\\\\nWith both agents configured, you can now initiate a task. For example, to print \\\\u201cHello World\\\\u201d, you would do the following:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(gpt_assistant, message=\\\\\"Print hello world\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nStep 6: Enabling Advanced Features\\\\n==================================\\\\n\\\\nFor more advanced coding tasks, such as code interpretation, you can enhance your GPTAssistantAgent with additional tools:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ngpt_assistant = GPTAssistantAgent(  \\\\n    name=\\\\\"assistant\\\\\",  \\\\n    llm_config={  \\\\n        \\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list,  \\\\n        \\\\\"assistant_id\\\\\": None,  \\\\n        \\\\\"tools\\\\\": [{\\\\\"type\\\\\": \\\\\"code_interpreter\\\\\"}],  \\\\n    })\\\\n```\\\\nthen test it with this:\\\\n<a name=\\\\\"readme-top\\\\\"></a>\\\\n\\\\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ag2.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ag2)\\\\n[![Build](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)\\\\n![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/3.8%20%7C%203.9%20%7C%203.10%20%7C%203.11%20%7C%203.12-blue)\\\\n[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/ag2/week)](https://pepy.tech/project/ag2)\\\\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1153072414184452236?logo=discord&style=flat)](https://aka.ms/autogen-dc)\\\\n[![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/cloudposse.svg?style=social&label=Follow%20%40ag2)](https://twitter.com/ag2)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n# AutoGen\\\\n[\\\\ud83d\\\\udcda Cite paper](#related-papers).\\\\n<!-- <p align=\\\\\"center\\\\\">\\\\n    <img src=\\\\\"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website/static/img/flaml.svg\\\\\"  width=200>\\\\n    <br>\\\\n</p> -->\\\\n:fire: Apr 17, 2024: Andrew Ng cited AutoGen in [The Batch newsletter](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-245/) and [What\\'s next for AI agentic workflows](https://youtu.be/sal78ACtGTc?si=JduUzN_1kDnMq0vF) at Sequoia Capital\\'s AI Ascent (Mar 26).\\\\n\\\\n:fire: Mar 3, 2024: What\\'s new in AutoGen? \\\\ud83d\\\\udcf0[Blog](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog/2024/03/03/AutoGen-Update); \\\\ud83d\\\\udcfa[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_mtwQiaLGU).\\\\n\\\\n:fire: Mar 1, 2024: the first AutoGen multi-agent experiment on the challenging [GAIA](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gaia-benchmark/leaderboard) benchmark achieved the No. 1 accuracy in all the three levels.\\\\n\\\\n:tada: Jan 30, 2024: AutoGen is highlighted by Peter Lee in Microsoft Research Forum [Keynote](https://t.co/nUBSjPDjqD).\\\\n\\\\n:tada: Dec 31, 2023: [AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155) is selected by [TheSequence: My Five Favorite AI Papers of 2023](https://thesequence.substack.com/p/my-five-favorite-ai-papers-of-2023).\\\\n\\\\n<!-- :fire: Nov 24: ag2 [v0.2](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/releases/tag/v0.2.0) is released with many updates and new features compared to v0.1.1.

You can install extra options based on the feature you need.\\\\n\\\\n<!-- For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`blendsearch`](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#blendsearch-economical-hyperparameter-optimization-with-blended-search-strategy) option.\\\\n```bash\\\\npip install \\\\\"ag2[blendsearch]\\\\\"\\\\n``` -->\\\\n\\\\nFind more options in [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Installation#option-2-install-autogen-locally-using-virtual-environment).\\\\n\\\\n<!-- Each of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed. -->\\\\n\\\\nEven if you are installing and running AutoGen locally outside of docker, the recommendation and default behavior of agents is to perform [code execution](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ/#code-execution) in docker. Find more instructions and how to change the default behaviour [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Installation#code-execution-with-docker-(default)).\\\\n\\\\nFor LLM inference configurations, check the [FAQs](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints).\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Multi-Agent Conversation Framework\\\\n\\\\nAutogen enables the next-gen LLM applications with a generic [multi-agent conversation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) framework. It offers customizable and conversable agents that integrate LLMs, tools, and humans.\\\\nBy automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.\\\\n\\\\nFeatures of this use case include:\\\\n\\\\n- **Multi-agent conversations**: AutoGen agents can communicate with each other to solve tasks. This allows for more complex and sophisticated applications than would be possible with a single LLM.\\\\n- **Customization**: AutoGen agents can be customized to meet the specific needs of an application. This includes the ability to choose the LLMs to use, the types of human input to allow, and the tools to employ.\\\\n- **Human participation**: AutoGen seamlessly allows human participation. This means that humans can provide input and feedback to the agents as needed.\\\\n\\\\nFor [example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/test/twoagent.py),\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nfrom autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json\\\\n# Load LLM inference endpoints from an env variable or a file\\\\n# See https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints\\\\n# and OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample\\\\nconfig_list = config_list_from_json(env_or_file=\\\\\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\\\\\")\\\\n# You can also set config_list directly as a list, for example, config_list = [{\\'model\\': \\'gpt-4\\', \\'api_key\\': \\'<your OpenAI API key here>\\'},]\\\\nassistant = AssistantAgent(\\\\\"assistant\\\\\", llm_config={\\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list})\\\\nuser_proxy = UserProxyAgent(\\\\\"user_proxy\\\\\", code_execution_config={\\\\\"work_dir\\\\\": \\\\\"coding\\\\\", \\\\\"use_docker\\\\\": False}) # IMPORTANT: set to True to run code in docker, recommended\\\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=\\\\\"Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD.\\\\\")\\\\n# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis example can be run with\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\npython test/twoagent.py\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAfter the repo is cloned.\\\\nThe figure below shows an example conversation flow with AutoGen.\\\\n![Agent Chat Example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website/static/img/chat_example.png)\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, the [sample code](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/samples/simple_chat.py) here allows a user to chat with an AutoGen agent in ChatGPT style.\\\\nPlease find more [code examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples#automated-multi-agent-chat) for this feature.\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Enhanced LLM Inferences\\\\n\\\\nAutogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers [enhanced LLM inference](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference#api-unification) with powerful functionalities like caching, error handling, multi-config inference and templating.\\\\n\\\\n<!-- For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics, and budgets.\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\n# perform tuning for openai<1\\\\nconfig, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(\\\\n    data=tune_data,\\\\n    metric=\\\\\"success\\\\\",\\\\n    mode=\\\\\"max\\\\\",\\\\n    eval_func=eval_func,\\\\n    inference_budget=0.05,\\\\n    optimization_budget=3,\\\\n    num_samples=-1,\\\\n)\\\\n# perform inference for a test instance\\\\nresponse = autogen.Completion.create(context=test_instance, **config)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nPlease find more [code examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples#tune-gpt-models) for this feature. -->\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Documentation\\\\n\\\\nYou can find detailed documentation about AutoGen [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/).\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, you can find:\\\\n\\\\n- [Research](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Research), [blogposts](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog) around AutoGen, and [Transparency FAQs](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/TRANSPARENCY_FAQS.md)\\\\n\\\\n- [Discord](https://aka.ms/autogen-dc)\\\\n\\\\n- [Contributing guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Contribute)\\\\n\\\\n- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/989/views/3)\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Related Papers\\\\n\\\\n[AutoGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155)\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@inproceedings{wu2023autogen,\\\\n      title={AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework},\\\\n      author={Qingyun Wu and Gagan Bansal and Jieyu Zhang and Yiran Wu and Beibin Li and Erkang Zhu and Li Jiang and Xiaoyun Zhang and Shaokun Zhang and Jiale Liu and Ahmed Hassan Awadallah and Ryen W White and Doug Burger and Chi Wang},\\\\n      year={2023},\\\\n      eprint={2308.08155},\\\\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\\\\n      primaryClass={cs.AI}\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n[EcoOptiGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673)\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@inproceedings{wang2023EcoOptiGen,\\\\n    title={Cost-Effective Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Generation Inference},\\\\n    author={Chi Wang and Susan Xueqing Liu and Ahmed H.

It offers customizable and conversable agents that integrate LLMs, tools, and humans.\\\\nBy automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.\\\\n\\\\nFeatures of this use case include:\\\\n\\\\n- **Multi-agent conversations**: AutoGen agents can communicate with each other to solve tasks. This allows for more complex and sophisticated applications than would be possible with a single LLM.\\\\n- **Customization**: AutoGen agents can be customized to meet the specific needs of an application. This includes the ability to choose the LLMs to use, the types of human input to allow, and the tools to employ.\\\\n- **Human participation**: AutoGen seamlessly allows human participation. This means that humans can provide input and feedback to the agents as needed.\\\\n\\\\nFor [example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/test/twoagent.py),\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nfrom autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json\\\\n# Load LLM inference endpoints from an env variable or a file\\\\n# See https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints\\\\n# and OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample\\\\nconfig_list = config_list_from_json(env_or_file=\\\\\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\\\\\")\\\\n# You can also set config_list directly as a list, for example, config_list = [{\\'model\\': \\'gpt-4\\', \\'api_key\\': \\'<your OpenAI API key here>\\'},]\\\\nassistant = AssistantAgent(\\\\\"assistant\\\\\", llm_config={\\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list})\\\\nuser_proxy = UserProxyAgent(\\\\\"user_proxy\\\\\", code_execution_config={\\\\\"work_dir\\\\\": \\\\\"coding\\\\\", \\\\\"use_docker\\\\\": False}) # IMPORTANT: set to True to run code in docker, recommended\\\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=\\\\\"Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD.\\\\\")\\\\n# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis example can be run with\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\npython test/twoagent.py\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAfter the repo is cloned.\\\\nThe figure below shows an example conversation flow with AutoGen.\\\\n![Agent Chat Example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website/static/img/chat_example.png)\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, the [sample code](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/samples/simple_chat.py) here allows a user to chat with an AutoGen agent in ChatGPT style.\\\\nPlease find more [code examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples#automated-multi-agent-chat) for this feature.\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Enhanced LLM Inferences\\\\n\\\\nAutogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers [enhanced LLM inference](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference#api-unification) with powerful functionalities like caching, error handling, multi-config inference and templating.\\\\n\\\\n<!-- For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics, and budgets.\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\n# perform tuning for openai<1\\\\nconfig, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(\\\\n    data=tune_data,\\\\n    metric=\\\\\"success\\\\\",\\\\n    mode=\\\\\"max\\\\\",\\\\n    eval_func=eval_func,\\\\n    inference_budget=0.05,\\\\n    optimization_budget=3,\\\\n    num_samples=-1,\\\\n)\\\\n# perform inference for a test instance\\\\nresponse = autogen.Completion.create(context=test_instance, **config)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nPlease find more [code examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples#tune-gpt-models) for this feature. -->\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Documentation\\\\n\\\\nYou can find detailed documentation about AutoGen [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/).\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, you can find:\\\\n\\\\n- [Research](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Research), [blogposts](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog) around AutoGen, and [Transparency FAQs](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/TRANSPARENCY_FAQS.md)\\\\n\\\\n- [Discord](https://aka.ms/autogen-dc)\\\\n\\\\n- [Contributing guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Contribute)\\\\n\\\\n- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/989/views/3)\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Related Papers\\\\n\\\\n[AutoGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155)\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@inproceedings{wu2023autogen,\\\\n      title={AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework},\\\\n      author={Qingyun Wu and Gagan Bansal and Jieyu Zhang and Yiran Wu and Beibin Li and Erkang Zhu and Li Jiang and Xiaoyun Zhang and Shaokun Zhang and Jiale Liu and Ahmed Hassan Awadallah and Ryen W White and Doug Burger and Chi Wang},\\\\n      year={2023},\\\\n      eprint={2308.08155},\\\\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\\\\n      primaryClass={cs.AI}\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n[EcoOptiGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673)\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@inproceedings{wang2023EcoOptiGen,\\\\n    title={Cost-Effective Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Generation Inference},\\\\n    author={Chi Wang and Susan Xueqing Liu and Ahmed H.

This integration allows for the creation of advanced, multi-agent systems capable of tackling complex coding tasks with unprecedented efficiency and intelligence. In this article, we will delve into how you can utilize AutoGen in conjunction with GPTs for sophisticated code interpretation, debugging, and development.\\\\n\\\\nStep 1: Setting Up Your Environment\\\\n===================================\\\\n\\\\nBefore diving into the practical application, you need to set up your environment. This involves installing the necessary AutoGen package. Execute the following command in your terminal:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n!pip install ag2==0.2.0b5\\\\n```\\\\nStep 2: Importing the Required Modules\\\\n======================================\\\\n\\\\nOnce the installation is complete, you need to import the necessary modules from AutoGen and configure them. Start by importing `config_list_from_json`, `GPTAssistantAgent`, and `UserProxyAgent`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nfrom autogen import config_list_from_json  \\\\nfrom autogen.agentchat.contrib.gpt_assistant_agent import GPTAssistantAgent  \\\\nfrom autogen import UserProxyAgent  \\\\n  \\\\n# config_list = config_list_from_json(\\\\\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\\\\\")  \\\\n  \\\\nconfig_list = [  \\\\n    {  \\\\n        \\'model\\': \\'gpt-4\\',  \\\\n        \\'api_key\\': \\'<put your openai key here>\\',  \\\\n    },  \\\\n]\\\\n```\\\\nStep 3: Creating the GPTAssistantAgent\\\\n======================================\\\\n\\\\nThe next step involves defining the OpenAI assistant agent. This agent will act as your primary interface with the GPT models:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ngpt_assistant = GPTAssistantAgent(  \\\\n    name=\\\\\"assistant\\\\\",  \\\\n    llm_config={  \\\\n        \\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list,  \\\\n        \\\\\"assistant_id\\\\\": None  \\\\n    })\\\\n```\\\\nStep 4: Setting Up the UserProxyAgent\\\\n=====================================\\\\n\\\\nThe `UserProxyAgent` serves as an intermediary for code execution and human input management. Set it up as follows:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nuser_proxy = UserProxyAgent(  \\\\n    name=\\\\\"user_proxy\\\\\",  \\\\n    code_execution_config={  \\\\n        \\\\\"work_dir\\\\\": \\\\\"coding\\\\\"  \\\\n    },  \\\\n    human_input_mode=\\\\\"NEVER\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nStep 5: Initiating the Task\\\\n===========================\\\\n\\\\nWith both agents configured, you can now initiate a task. For example, to print \\\\u201cHello World\\\\u201d, you would do the following:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(gpt_assistant, message=\\\\\"Print hello world\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nStep 6: Enabling Advanced Features\\\\n==================================\\\\n\\\\nFor more advanced coding tasks, such as code interpretation, you can enhance your GPTAssistantAgent with additional tools:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ngpt_assistant = GPTAssistantAgent(  \\\\n    name=\\\\\"assistant\\\\\",  \\\\n    llm_config={  \\\\n        \\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list,  \\\\n        \\\\\"assistant_id\\\\\": None,  \\\\n        \\\\\"tools\\\\\": [{\\\\\"type\\\\\": \\\\\"code_interpreter\\\\\"}],  \\\\n    })\\\\n```\\\\nthen test it with this:\\\\n```\\\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(gpt_assistant, message=\\\\\"Get the price of gold and print a visual of the last 4 days closing price\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\n![]()Conclusion\\\\n==========\\\\n\\\\nThe integration of AutoGen and OpenAI\\\\u2019s GPTs marks a significant advancement in AI-driven coding. This combination not only streamlines the coding process but also opens new avenues for tackling complex software development challenges. With these steps, you can start leveraging this powerful duo to enhance your coding projects, be it for debugging, writing new code snippets, or even learning new programming concepts.\\\\n\\\\nFuture Perspectives\\\\n===================\\\\n\\\\nWhile there are limitations, such as the pending integration of group chat managers and the anticipation of multimodal capabilities, the potential for growth and enhancement in this area is immense. The ongoing developments in AutoGen and GPT integration promise a future where coding and software development are more intuitive, efficient, and aligned with the evolving needs of developers.\\\\n\\\\n[Data Science](https://medium.com/tag/data-science?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c---------------data_science-----------------)[Machine Learning](https://medium.com/tag/machine-learning?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c---------------machine_learning-----------------)[Artificial Intelligence](https://medium.com/tag/artificial-intelligence?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c---------------artificial_intelligence-----------------)[Technology](https://medium.com/tag/technology?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c---------------technology-----------------)[ChatGPT](https://medium.com/tag/chatgpt?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c---------------chatgpt-----------------)--\\\\n\\\\n--\\\\n\\\\n[![Dr. Ernesto Lee](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:144:144/1*nzdYUSs4c2RQs2W0FCHv1g.jpeg)](/?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)[Follow](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fsubscribe%2Fuser%2F53ee0651b83e&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdrlee.io%2Fharnessing-the-power-of-autogen-and-openai-gpts-for-advanced-code-interpretation-and-development-571ddb6f814c&user=Dr.+Ernesto+Lee&userId=53ee0651b83e&source=post_page-53ee0651b83e----571ddb6f814c---------------------follow_profile-----------)[Written by Dr. Ernesto Lee\\\\n--------------------------](/?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)[1.5K Followers](/followers?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)Miami Dade College Data Analytics Faculty and Chief Innovation Officer [TriveraTech.com](http://TriveraTech.com)\\\\n\\\\n[Follow](https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fsubscribe%2Fuser%2F53ee0651b83e&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdrlee.io%2Fharnessing-the-power-of-autogen-and-openai-gpts-for-advanced-code-interpretation-and-development-571ddb6f814c&user=Dr.+Ernesto+Lee&userId=53ee0651b83e&source=post_page-53ee0651b83e----571ddb6f814c---------------------follow_profile-----------)[Help](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)[Status](https://medium.statuspage.io/?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)[About](https://medium.com/about?autoplay=1&source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)[Careers](https://medium.com/jobs-at-medium/work-at-medium-959d1a85284e?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)[Blog](https://blog.medium.com/?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)[Privacy](https://policy.medium.com/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)[Terms](https://policy.medium.com/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)[Text to speech](https://speechify.com/medium?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)[Teams](https://medium.com/business?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c--------------------------------)\\\\n<a name=\\\\\"readme-top\\\\\"></a>\\\\n\\\\n[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ag2.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/ag2)\\\\n[![Build](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/actions/workflows/python-package.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/actions/workflows/python-package.yml)\\\\n![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/3.8%20%7C%203.9%20%7C%203.10%20%7C%203.11%20%7C%203.12-blue)\\\\n[![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/ag2/week)](https://pepy.tech/project/ag2)\\\\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1153072414184452236?logo=discord&style=flat)](https://aka.ms/autogen-dc)\\\\n[![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url/https/twitter.com/cloudposse.svg?style=social&label=Follow%20%40ag2)](https://twitter.com/ag2)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n# AutoGen\\\\n[\\\\ud83d\\\\udcda Cite paper](#related-papers).\\\\n<!-- <p align=\\\\\"center\\\\\">\\\\n    <img src=\\\\\"https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website/static/img/flaml.svg\\\\\"  width=200>\\\\n    <br>\\\\n</p> -->\\\\n:fire: Apr 17, 2024: Andrew Ng cited AutoGen in [The Batch newsletter](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-245/) and [What\\'s next for AI agentic workflows](https://youtu.be/sal78ACtGTc?si=JduUzN_1kDnMq0vF) at Sequoia Capital\\'s AI Ascent (Mar 26).\\\\n\\\\n:fire: Mar 3, 2024: What\\'s new in AutoGen?

AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools.\\\\n\\\\n![AutoGen Overview](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website/static/img/autogen_agentchat.png)\\\\n\\\\n- AutoGen enables building next-gen LLM applications based on [multi-agent conversations](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) with minimal effort. It simplifies the orchestration, automation, and optimization of a complex LLM workflow. It maximizes the performance of LLM models and overcomes their weaknesses.\\\\n- It supports [diverse conversation patterns](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat#supporting-diverse-conversation-patterns) for complex workflows. With customizable and conversable agents, developers can use AutoGen to build a wide range of conversation patterns concerning conversation autonomy,\\\\n  the number of agents, and agent conversation topology.\\\\n- It provides a collection of working systems with different complexities. These systems span a [wide range of applications](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat#diverse-applications-implemented-with-autogen) from various domains and complexities. This demonstrates how AutoGen can easily support diverse conversation patterns.\\\\n- AutoGen provides [enhanced LLM inference](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference#api-unification). It offers utilities like API unification and caching, and advanced usage patterns, such as error handling, multi-config inference, context programming, etc.\\\\n\\\\nAutoGen is powered by collaborative [research studies](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Research) from Microsoft, Penn State University, and the University of Washington.\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Roadmaps\\\\n\\\\nTo see what we are working on and what we plan to work on, please check our\\\\n[Roadmap Issues](https://aka.ms/autogen-roadmap).\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Quickstart\\\\nThe easiest way to start playing is\\\\n1.

Install and Run AutoGen in Docker\\\\n\\\\nFind detailed instructions for users [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/installation/Docker#step-1-install-docker), and for developers [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Contribute#docker-for-development).\\\\n\\\\n### Option 2. Install AutoGen Locally\\\\n\\\\nAutoGen requires **Python version >= 3.8, < 3.13**. It can be installed from pip:\\\\n\\\\n```bash\\\\npip install ag2\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nMinimal dependencies are installed without extra options. You can install extra options based on the feature you need.\\\\n\\\\n<!-- For example, use the following to install the dependencies needed by the [`blendsearch`](https://microsoft.github.io/FLAML/docs/Use-Cases/Tune-User-Defined-Function#blendsearch-economical-hyperparameter-optimization-with-blended-search-strategy) option.\\\\n```bash\\\\npip install \\\\\"ag2[blendsearch]\\\\\"\\\\n``` -->\\\\n\\\\nFind more options in [Installation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Installation#option-2-install-autogen-locally-using-virtual-environment).\\\\n\\\\n<!-- Each of the [`notebook examples`](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/notebook) may require a specific option to be installed. -->\\\\n\\\\nEven if you are installing and running AutoGen locally outside of docker, the recommendation and default behavior of agents is to perform [code execution](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ/#code-execution) in docker. Find more instructions and how to change the default behaviour [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Installation#code-execution-with-docker-(default)).\\\\n\\\\nFor LLM inference configurations, check the [FAQs](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints).\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Multi-Agent Conversation Framework\\\\n\\\\nAutogen enables the next-gen LLM applications with a generic [multi-agent conversation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat) framework. It offers customizable and conversable agents that integrate LLMs, tools, and humans.\\\\nBy automating chat among multiple capable agents, one can easily make them collectively perform tasks autonomously or with human feedback, including tasks that require using tools via code.\\\\n\\\\nFeatures of this use case include:\\\\n\\\\n- **Multi-agent conversations**: AutoGen agents can communicate with each other to solve tasks. This allows for more complex and sophisticated applications than would be possible with a single LLM.\\\\n- **Customization**: AutoGen agents can be customized to meet the specific needs of an application. This includes the ability to choose the LLMs to use, the types of human input to allow, and the tools to employ.\\\\n- **Human participation**: AutoGen seamlessly allows human participation. This means that humans can provide input and feedback to the agents as needed.\\\\n\\\\nFor [example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/test/twoagent.py),\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\nfrom autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json\\\\n# Load LLM inference endpoints from an env variable or a file\\\\n# See https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/FAQ#set-your-api-endpoints\\\\n# and OAI_CONFIG_LIST_sample\\\\nconfig_list = config_list_from_json(env_or_file=\\\\\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\\\\\")\\\\n# You can also set config_list directly as a list, for example, config_list = [{\\'model\\': \\'gpt-4\\', \\'api_key\\': \\'<your OpenAI API key here>\\'},]\\\\nassistant = AssistantAgent(\\\\\"assistant\\\\\", llm_config={\\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list})\\\\nuser_proxy = UserProxyAgent(\\\\\"user_proxy\\\\\", code_execution_config={\\\\\"work_dir\\\\\": \\\\\"coding\\\\\", \\\\\"use_docker\\\\\": False}) # IMPORTANT: set to True to run code in docker, recommended\\\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message=\\\\\"Plot a chart of NVDA and TESLA stock price change YTD.\\\\\")\\\\n# This initiates an automated chat between the two agents to solve the task\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis example can be run with\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\npython test/twoagent.py\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nAfter the repo is cloned.\\\\nThe figure below shows an example conversation flow with AutoGen.\\\\n![Agent Chat Example](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/website/static/img/chat_example.png)\\\\n\\\\nAlternatively, the [sample code](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/samples/simple_chat.py) here allows a user to chat with an AutoGen agent in ChatGPT style.\\\\nPlease find more [code examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples#automated-multi-agent-chat) for this feature.\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Enhanced LLM Inferences\\\\n\\\\nAutogen also helps maximize the utility out of the expensive LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4. It offers [enhanced LLM inference](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/enhanced_inference#api-unification) with powerful functionalities like caching, error handling, multi-config inference and templating.\\\\n\\\\n<!-- For example, you can optimize generations by LLM with your own tuning data, success metrics, and budgets.\\\\n\\\\n```python\\\\n# perform tuning for openai<1\\\\nconfig, analysis = autogen.Completion.tune(\\\\n    data=tune_data,\\\\n    metric=\\\\\"success\\\\\",\\\\n    mode=\\\\\"max\\\\\",\\\\n    eval_func=eval_func,\\\\n    inference_budget=0.05,\\\\n    optimization_budget=3,\\\\n    num_samples=-1,\\\\n)\\\\n# perform inference for a test instance\\\\nresponse = autogen.Completion.create(context=test_instance, **config)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nPlease find more [code examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples#tune-gpt-models) for this feature. -->\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Documentation\\\\n\\\\nYou can find detailed documentation about AutoGen [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/).\\\\n\\\\nIn addition, you can find:\\\\n\\\\n- [Research](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Research), [blogposts](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/blog) around AutoGen, and [Transparency FAQs](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/main/TRANSPARENCY_FAQS.md)\\\\n\\\\n- [Discord](https://aka.ms/autogen-dc)\\\\n\\\\n- [Contributing guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Contribute)\\\\n\\\\n- [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/projects/989/views/3)\\\\n\\\\n<p align=\\\\\"right\\\\\" style=\\\\\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 20px;\\\\\">\\\\n  <a href=\\\\\"#readme-top\\\\\" style=\\\\\"text-decoration: none; color: blue; font-weight: bold;\\\\\">\\\\n    \\\\u2191 Back to Top \\\\u2191\\\\n  </a>\\\\n</p>\\\\n\\\\n## Related Papers\\\\n\\\\n[AutoGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155)\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@inproceedings{wu2023autogen,\\\\n      title={AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework},\\\\n      author={Qingyun Wu and Gagan Bansal and Jieyu Zhang and Yiran Wu and Beibin Li and Erkang Zhu and Li Jiang and Xiaoyun Zhang and Shaokun Zhang and Jiale Liu and Ahmed Hassan Awadallah and Ryen W White and Doug Burger and Chi Wang},\\\\n      year={2023},\\\\n      eprint={2308.08155},\\\\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\\\\n      primaryClass={cs.AI}\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n[EcoOptiGen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04673)\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@inproceedings{wang2023EcoOptiGen,\\\\n    title={Cost-Effective Hyperparameter Optimization for Large Language Model Generation Inference},\\\\n    author={Chi Wang and Susan Xueqing Liu and Ahmed H.

This involves installing the necessary AutoGen package. Execute the following command in your terminal:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n!pip install ag2==0.2.0b5\\\\n```\\\\nStep 2: Importing the Required Modules\\\\n======================================\\\\n\\\\nOnce the installation is complete, you need to import the necessary modules from AutoGen and configure them. Start by importing `config_list_from_json`, `GPTAssistantAgent`, and `UserProxyAgent`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nfrom autogen import config_list_from_json  \\\\nfrom autogen.agentchat.contrib.gpt_assistant_agent import GPTAssistantAgent  \\\\nfrom autogen import UserProxyAgent  \\\\n  \\\\n# config_list = config_list_from_json(\\\\\"OAI_CONFIG_LIST\\\\\")  \\\\n  \\\\nconfig_list = [  \\\\n    {  \\\\n        \\'model\\': \\'gpt-4\\',  \\\\n        \\'api_key\\': \\'<put your openai key here>\\',  \\\\n    },  \\\\n]\\\\n```\\\\nStep 3: Creating the GPTAssistantAgent\\\\n======================================\\\\n\\\\nThe next step involves defining the OpenAI assistant agent. This agent will act as your primary interface with the GPT models:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ngpt_assistant = GPTAssistantAgent(  \\\\n    name=\\\\\"assistant\\\\\",  \\\\n    llm_config={  \\\\n        \\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list,  \\\\n        \\\\\"assistant_id\\\\\": None  \\\\n    })\\\\n```\\\\nStep 4: Setting Up the UserProxyAgent\\\\n=====================================\\\\n\\\\nThe `UserProxyAgent` serves as an intermediary for code execution and human input management. Set it up as follows:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nuser_proxy = UserProxyAgent(  \\\\n    name=\\\\\"user_proxy\\\\\",  \\\\n    code_execution_config={  \\\\n        \\\\\"work_dir\\\\\": \\\\\"coding\\\\\"  \\\\n    },  \\\\n    human_input_mode=\\\\\"NEVER\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nStep 5: Initiating the Task\\\\n===========================\\\\n\\\\nWith both agents configured, you can now initiate a task. For example, to print \\\\u201cHello World\\\\u201d, you would do the following:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(gpt_assistant, message=\\\\\"Print hello world\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\nStep 6: Enabling Advanced Features\\\\n==================================\\\\n\\\\nFor more advanced coding tasks, such as code interpretation, you can enhance your GPTAssistantAgent with additional tools:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ngpt_assistant = GPTAssistantAgent(  \\\\n    name=\\\\\"assistant\\\\\",  \\\\n    llm_config={  \\\\n        \\\\\"config_list\\\\\": config_list,  \\\\n        \\\\\"assistant_id\\\\\": None,  \\\\n        \\\\\"tools\\\\\": [{\\\\\"type\\\\\": \\\\\"code_interpreter\\\\\"}],  \\\\n    })\\\\n```\\\\nthen test it with this:\\\\n```\\\\nuser_proxy.initiate_chat(gpt_assistant, message=\\\\\"Get the price of gold and print a visual of the last 4 days closing price\\\\\")\\\\n```\\\\n![]()Conclusion\\\\n==========\\\\n\\\\nThe integration of AutoGen and OpenAI\\\\u2019s GPTs marks a significant advancement in AI-driven coding. This combination not only streamlines the coding process but also opens new avenues for tackling complex software development challenges. With these steps, you can start leveraging this powerful duo to enhance your coding projects, be it for debugging, writing new code snippets, or even learning new programming concepts.\\\\n\\\\nFuture Perspectives\\\\n===================\\\\n\\\\nWhile there are limitations, such as the pending integration of group chat managers and the anticipation of multimodal capabilities, the potential for growth and enhancement in this area is immense. The ongoing developments in AutoGen and GPT integration promise a future where coding and software development are more intuitive, efficient, and aligned with the evolving needs of developers.\\\\n\\\\n[Data Science](https://medium.com/tag/data-science?source=post_page-----571ddb6f814c---------------data_science-----------------)[Machine

When you need to collect info, use the code to output the info you need, for example, browse or search the web, download/read a file, print the content of a webpage or a file, get the current date/time, check the operating system. After sufficient info is printed and the task is ready to be solved based on your language skill, you can solve the task by yourself.\\\\n    2. When you need to perform some task with code, use the code to perform the task and output the result. Finish the task smartly.\\\\nSolve the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. Be clear which step uses code, and which step uses your language skill.\\\\nWhen using code, you must indicate the script type in the code block. The user cannot provide any other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. The user can\\'t modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify. Don\\'t use a code block if it\\'s not intended to be executed by the user.\\\\nIf you want the user to save the code in a file before executing it, put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line. Don\\'t include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use \\'print\\' function for the output when relevant. Check the execution result returned by the user.\\\\nIf the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can\\'t be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\\\\nWhen you find an answer, verify the answer carefully.
