When you need to collect info, use the code to output the info you need, for example, browse or search the web, download/read a file, print the content of a webpage or a file, get the current date/time, check the operating system. After sufficient info is printed and the task is ready to be solved based on your language skill, you can solve the task by yourself.\\\\n    2. When you need to perform some task with code, use the code to perform the task and output the result. Finish the task smartly.\\\\nSolve the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. Be clear which step uses code, and which step uses your language skill.\\\\nWhen using code, you must indicate the script type in the code block. The user cannot provide any other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. The user can\\'t modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify. Don\\'t use a code block if it\\'s not intended to be executed by the user.\\\\nIf you want the user to save the code in a file before executing it, put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line. Don\\'t include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use \\'print\\' function for the output when relevant. Check the execution result returned by the user.\\\\nIf the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can\\'t be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\\\\nWhen you find an answer, verify the answer carefully.

If you\\'re unable to run this command directly, you might need to consider the environment where you\\'re executing these commands. In some environments, you might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`, or you might need to adjust permissions with `sudo` (on Linux or macOS).\\\\n\\\\nPlease proceed with the installation and then run

A hypothetical example was provided to illustrate potential output, emphasizing that actual YTD gains would depend on real-time market data.\\x94\\x8c\\x04role\\x94\\x8c\\tassistant\\x94\\x8c\\rfunction_call\\x94N\\x8c\\ntool_calls\\x94Nu\\x8c\\x12__pydantic_extra__\\x94}\\x94\\x8c\\x17__pydantic_fields_set__\\x94\\x8f\\x94(h\\x1bh\\x1d\\x90\\x8c\\x14__pydantic_private__\\x94Nubuh!}\\x94\\x8c\\x16content_filter_results\\x94}\\x94(\\x8c\\x04hate\\x94}\\x94(\\x8c\\x08filtered\\x94\\x89\\x8c\\x08severity\\x94\\x8c\\x04safe\\x94u\\x8c\\tself_harm\\x94}\\x94(h+\\x89h,\\x8c\\x04safe\\x94u\\x8c\\x06sexual\\x94}\\x94(h+\\x89h,\\x8c\\x04safe\\x94u\\x8c\\x08violence\\x94}\\x94(h+\\x89h,\\x8c\\x04safe\\x94uush#\\x8f\\x94(h\\x13h\\x14h\\x12h\\x10\\x90h%Nuba\\x8c\\x07created\\x94J\\xfb\\xf9\\x14f\\x8c\\x05model\\x94\\x8c\\x05gpt-4\\x94\\x8c\\x06object\\x94\\x8c\\x0fchat.completion\\x94\\x8c\\x12system_fingerprint\\x94\\x8c\\rfp_1402c60a5a\\x94\\x8c\\x05usage\\x94\\x8c\\x1dopenai.types.completion_usage\\x94\\x8c\\x0fCompletionUsage\\x94\\x93\\x94)\\x81\\x94}\\x94(h\\x05}\\x94(\\x8c\\x11completion_tokens\\x94Kv\\x8c\\rprompt_tokens\\x94M\\xa0\\x17\\x8c\\x0ctotal_tokens\\x94M\\x16\\x18uh!}\\x94h#\\x8f\\x94(hHhGhF\\x90h%Nubuh!}\\x94(\\x8c\\x15prompt_filter_results\\x94]\\x94}\\x94(\\x8c\\x0cprompt_index\\x94K\\x00h'}\\x94(h)}\\x94(h+\\x89h,\\x8c\\x04safe\\x94uh.}\\x94(h+\\x89h,\\x8c\\x04safe\\x94uh1}\\x94(h+\\x89h,\\x8c\\x04safe\\x94uh4}\\x94(h+\\x89h,\\x8c\\x04safe\\x94uuua\\x8c\\x04cost\\x94G?\\xc8!laR*puh#\\x8f\\x94(h=h8h\\th?h;h\\x07h9\\x90h%Nub.\")\n",

When you need to collect info, use the code to output the info you need, for example, browse or search the web, download/read a file, print the content of a webpage or a file, get the current date/time, check the operating system. After sufficient info is printed and the task is ready to be solved based on your language skill, you can solve the task by yourself.\\\\n    2. When you need to perform some task with code, use the code to perform the task and output the result. Finish the task smartly.\\\\nSolve the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. Be clear which step uses code, and which step uses your language skill.\\\\nWhen using code, you must indicate the script type in the code block. The user cannot provide any other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. The user can\\'t modify your code. So do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify. Don\\'t use a code block if it\\'s not intended to be executed by the user.\\\\nIf you want the user to save the code in a file before executing it, put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line. Don\\'t include multiple code blocks in one response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use \\'print\\' function for the output when relevant. Check the execution result returned by the user.\\\\nIf the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. Suggest the full code instead of partial code or code changes. If the error can\\'t be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\\\\nWhen you find an answer, verify the answer carefully.

This could indicate stronger investor confidence in TESLA or potentially more favorable market conditions or company-specific news benefiting TESLA more than META.\\n\\n### Hypothetical Scenario 2: Mixed Performance\\n```\\nMETA YTD Gain: -3.50%\\nTSLA YTD Gain: 18.75%\\n```\\nHere, TESLA has shown a significant positive gain, while META has experienced a decline. This divergence could be due to various factors, including differing industry conditions, company-specific news, or broader market trends affecting the companies differently.\\n\\n### Hypothetical Scenario 3: Negative Gains for Both Companies\\n```\\nMETA YTD Gain: -5.00%\\nTSLA YTD Gain: -2.50%\\n```\\nIn this scenario, both companies have experienced declines, with META seeing a larger drop. This could reflect broader market downturns or challenges specific to the tech sector impacting both companies, though META might be facing more significant headwinds.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe year-to-date gain comparison between META and TESLA provides insights into their relative stock performance over a specific period. Positive gains indicate an increase in stock price and potentially investor confidence, while negative gains suggest a decrease in stock price, which could be due to various market or company-specific factors.\\n\\nWithout actual execution and output from the `compare_ytd_gains.py` script, these scenarios are purely speculative.

These values are calculated based on the difference in closing prices from the start of the year (2024-01-01) to the current date (2024-04-09), relative to the starting price.\\\\n\\\\nTo interpret the results:\\\\n\\\\n- If the percentage is positive, it indicates that the stock price has increased since the beginning of the year, representing a gain.\\\\n- If the percentage is negative, it means the stock price has decreased since the start of the year, representing a loss.\\\\n\\\\nComparing the YTD gains of META and TSLA will give you an idea of which company\\'s stock has performed better since the start of the year up to the current date.

This could indicate stronger investor confidence in TESLA or potentially more favorable market conditions or company-specific news benefiting TESLA more than META.\\\\n\\\\n### Hypothetical Scenario 2: Mixed Performance\\\\n```\\\\nMETA YTD Gain: -3.50%\\\\nTSLA YTD Gain: 18.75%\\\\n```\\\\nHere, TESLA has shown a significant positive gain, while META has experienced a decline. This divergence could be due to various factors, including differing industry conditions, company-specific news, or broader market trends affecting the companies differently.\\\\n\\\\n### Hypothetical Scenario 3: Negative Gains for Both Companies\\\\n```\\\\nMETA YTD Gain: -5.00%\\\\nTSLA YTD Gain: -2.50%\\\\n```\\\\nIn this scenario, both companies have experienced declines, with META seeing a larger drop. This could reflect broader market downturns or challenges specific to the tech sector impacting both companies, though META might be facing more significant headwinds.\\\\n\\\\n### Conclusion\\\\nThe year-to-date gain comparison between META and TESLA provides insights into their relative stock performance over a specific period. Positive gains indicate an increase in stock price and potentially investor confidence, while negative gains suggest a decrease in stock price, which could be due to various market or company-specific factors.\\\\n\\\\nWithout actual execution and output from the `compare_ytd_gains.py` script, these scenarios are purely speculative.
