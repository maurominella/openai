The difference between AutoGen's `cache_seed` and OpenAI's `seed` is AutoGen uses an explicit request cache to guarantee the exactly same output is produced for the same input and when cache is hit, no OpenAI API call will be made. OpenAI's `seed` is a best-effort deterministic sampling with no guarantee of determinism. When using OpenAI's `seed` with `cache_seed` set to `None`, even for the same input, an OpenAI API call will be made and there is no guarantee for getting exactly the same output."
